This dataset contains 180 observations and 68 columns, with each row representing measurements per activity and per subject.

Only variables with mean and standard deviation values were retained, calculated for each subject and activity.

Column descriptions are as follows:

act_id - corresponds to a specific activity with mapping outlined below:

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

subj_id - corresponds to subject from whom data was tested; numbered 1 to 30.
Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

Mean and Std variables:
